Structure of the content of this folder:

The code that contains the design, implementation and evaluation of the 3D-GANs,
it is on the root folder and it is named as follows:

MinecraftGAN.ipynb

On the training_checkpoints folder some trained models are stored.
There are two paths:
	'0-1' contains the 0-1 models trained for 1000 epochs
	'all materials' contains the all materials models trained for 1500 epochs
The '100' in a trained model folder means that the filters dimension used was 100 instead of the
standard 200.
In every folder of a trained model there is also a settlement in the format of a schematic file
that was generated from that trained model.


The code of the NBT library is on the root folder.
The files are named as follows:

schematic.py
	library that allows to manage NBT files and schematic files.

SchematicTools.py
	code built upon the schematic.py in order to create easy access tools

The code used to generate the data set is in the MCEdit folder.
Here it can be found a filter made by a Reddit user.
It was modified to generate a data set that is located in the dateset808016 folder.
The data set can be found in the supplemental file submission.

The files are named as follows:

Settlement.py
	The main file of the filter that was modified in order to generate the data set.
SettlementAStar.py
SettlementGenerator.py
SettlementStructure.py
SettlementStructureDetails.py
